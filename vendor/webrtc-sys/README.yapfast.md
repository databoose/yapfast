# Yapfast patches

This is webrtc-sys 0.3.35 from crates.io under its original Apache-2.0 license.
Four changes differ from it.

## Windows link fix

include/livekit/jsep.h differs: PeerContext is forward-declared as struct,
matching the generated cxx bridge. The mismatched class declaration produced
undefined observer constructors and Box<PeerContext>::drop on Windows MSVC.

This backports the one-line fix documented in LiveKit issue 1154:
https://github.com/livekit/rust-sdks/issues/1154

## Capture leveling

src/capture.rs and the `CaptureLeveling` class in
src/peer_connection_factory.cpp hand every call's captured audio, after WebRTC's
processing, to a processor the application sets with
`capture::set_capture_processor`. Yapfast levels the voice there. build.rs lists
the new bridge.

## Remote track volume

LiveKit's Rust API can't set how loud a remote track plays. src/audio_track.cpp
keeps each audio track wrapper in a registry by track id, and the new
`set_audio_track_volume` bridge function passes a volume to the matching
tracks' sources on the signaling thread, as WebRTC's `SetVolume` expects.

## Camera capture from pooled buffers

LiveKit's `NativeVideoSource::capture_frame` takes a new I420 buffer for each
frame, and the encoder holds it for a while, so a camera filming at 30 frames
a second allocates 30 buffers a second. The new `capture_i420` bridge method
on `VideoTrackSource` copies the application's picture, scaled if WebRTC's
adapter asks for less, into a buffer from a `VideoFrameBufferPool` of four,
which WebRTC reuses once the encoder lets go. libwebrtc's Rust
`NativeVideoSource` keeps its native handle private, so
`last_video_track_source` returns the source most recently made on the
calling thread; Yapfast asks for it right after making one. `release_buffers`
empties the pool while the camera is off. Both are in
src/video_track.cpp and include/livekit/video_track.h.

Otherwise the Rust API, media code, dependency versions and libwebrtc archive
stay pinned.
