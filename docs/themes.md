# Themes

Settings → Appearance shows the window in one of the themes Talk comes with.
Each is a full set of the colours of the Slint global `Theme`
(`ui/theme.slint`), plus whether it's dark, which sets the std-widgets' colour
scheme. `src/ui/theme.rs` holds them as `BUILT_IN`; DESIGN.md says what each
colour paints, under Colors. The choice is kept in `layout.json` as `theme`,
the theme's id, and applied before the window's first frame, and again to a
window made anew. An id Talk doesn't know shows Yap.

The palettes of Catppuccin, Dracula, Nord, Gruvbox, Tokyo Night and Rosé Pine
are published under the MIT licence; thanks to their authors. For Tokyo
Night, the steps between its grounds and text (bg_highlight, fg_gutter, dark3,
dark5) are named as folke's tokyonight.nvim names them. Talk takes their
colours, not their names for UI parts, so each mapping is Talk's:

- The ground steps go rail, sidebar, chat from the deepest to the one text
  sits on, with raised surfaces (popovers, reactions, stage tiles) and the
  composer one step off the chat. Where a palette has no shade below its
  background (Nord's nord0, Tokyo Night's bg_dark), the rail, panel and edge
  darken it, and hover and some row grounds are halfway mixes of two palette
  colours.
- Text, secondary, muted and faint take the palette's text ramp; faint keeps
  at least 2.5:1 against the sidebar, near Yap's 2.8:1.
- Content on the accent and on red (on-accent, on-danger) takes the palette's
  darkest or lightest colour, whichever reads; on pastel accents, as in
  Catppuccin and Tokyo Night, that's dark.
- Light themes wash hovers with a dark overlay (black, or the palette's text
  colour) instead of white, sweep skeletons with a white band, and draw the
  tooltip light, since its text is the theme's text colour.

Bonfire maps Discord's Dark theme from the CSS variables of its web client
(`.theme-dark` with `.theme-darker`, which is what its settings call Dark;
`.theme-dark` alone is Ash, `.theme-midnight` Onyx), read from the public bundle
on 2026-10-14: the rail and sidebar are `--background-base-lowest` (#121214),
the chat `--background-base-lower` (#1a1a1e), the account panel and composer
`--background-base-low` (#202024), raised surfaces and the tooltip
`--background-surface-high` (#242429), text `--text-default`, muted
`--text-muted`, links `--text-link`, the accent `--control-primary-background-default`
(blurple, #5865f2, hover #4452bb, white on it), red
`--control-critical-primary-background-default` (#d22d39), live
`--status-positive`, and hovers, selections, lines and secondary buttons the
`--interactive-background-*`, `--border-subtle` and
`--control-secondary-background-*` washes laid over their grounds. It carries
no Discord name or logo.

Discord role colours stay as servers set them, and some read faintly on a
light theme; Talk doesn't adjust them yet.
